## micromotors
Scripts for scientific cooperation in micromotor research

#### Purpose
This is a simple script meant to analyze the pac-man shaped micromotor asymmetry.

#### Installation
The script is intended for standard python 3.x, and uses tkinter and PIL libraries. Please note that in python 2.x tkinter uses a capital 'T' (Tkinter).

#### Usage
The script lets the user mark points in the same horizontal position, a central line and calculates the mean distance from points to line. Points can be removed, and the central line can be adjusted at any time.
